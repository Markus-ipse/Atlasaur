# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` — `tsc -b && vite build` (typecheck is part of the production build)
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` only
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config, typescript-eslint + react-hooks + react-refresh)
- `npm test` — Vitest in `run` mode (jsdom env). Single test: `npx vitest run src/game/useGame.test.ts -t "answer-correct"`. Watch mode: `npx vitest`.
- `npm run build:countries` — Regenerates `src/data/countries.json` from `scripts/build-countries.mjs`. Run this any time you edit the COUNTRIES table in that script; the JSON is committed but is a build artifact.

## Architecture

### Game state lives in one reducer

`src/game/useGame.ts` is the single source of truth. `App.tsx` calls `useGame()` once and passes the resulting `GameApi` (state + dispatchers + lookup helpers) down to `ControlZone`; `WorldMap` receives only the slices of `GameApi` it needs as individual props. Components are otherwise stateless — do not introduce parallel game state in components.

The reducer (`reducer` in `useGame.ts`) handles `answer | skip | dismiss | setMode | setContinents | endSession | startReview | reset`. Effects (timed auto-dismiss of correct feedback, localStorage persistence) live in the `useGame` hook itself, not in the reducer.

### Two phases, one retry queue

State has a `phase: "normal" | "review"` and a `retryQueue: { iso3, dueAt }[]`:

- **Normal phase:** wrong/skipped answers append the country to `retryQueue` with `dueAt = total + randInt(3, 5)`. `pickNext` (in `pickCountry.ts`) prefers a due retry over a fresh random pick. Score, streak, missed list, and total only advance in normal phase.
- **Review phase:** entered via `startReview` after session end. Picks always come from the head of `retryQueue`; correct answers remove the entry, wrong answers re-queue it. When the queue empties, `dismissFeedback` flips back to normal and sets `sessionDone: true` so the summary re-opens.

`unlearnedCount` exposed on `GameApi` is just `retryQueue.length` — that's what drives the "Review N" affordance.

### Two ID spaces: numeric vs iso3

- `numeric` (zero-padded ISO-3166-1 numeric, e.g. `"250"`) is what `world-atlas` topology uses as `feature.id`. The map renders against numeric.
- `iso3` (e.g. `"FRA"`) is the canonical key used everywhere in game state, in `countries.json`, and in feedback objects.

Convert at the boundary using `isoFromNumeric` / `numericFromIso3` from `GameApi`. `WorldMap` does not import `countries.json` — it gets these helpers as props so the map is decoupled from the country list.

### Country data is generated, not hand-edited

`src/data/countries.json` is the output of `scripts/build-countries.mjs`. To add aliases, fix a name, or change a continent assignment, edit the `COUNTRIES` table in the script and run `npm run build:countries`. The script intersects with the topology and warns about (a) entries in the table missing from the topology (won't render at the `countries-110m` resolution) and (b) topology features missing from the table (render but inert). The continent assignments follow UN M49 with documented exceptions for transcontinental cases (Russia → Europe, Turkey/Caucasus/Kazakhstan → Asia, etc.) — preserve those conventions when editing.

Typed-answer matching (shape-to-name mode) compares `normalize(input)` against `normalize(name | ...aliases)` — `normalize` strips diacritics, lowercases, removes apostrophes, collapses whitespace. Don't normalize aliases in the source table; the matcher does it.

### WorldMap: module-level projection, runtime zoom

The Equal-Earth projection, all path `d` strings, the label list, and `FEATURE_BY_NUMERIC` are computed once at module load — they only depend on the projection. Re-renders during pan/zoom apply a CSS `transform` to a single `<g>` element; the path data does not change. If you need to recompute paths, you're probably doing something wrong; consider whether the change can be expressed via fill/highlight state in `fillFor` instead.

`fillFor` is the single decision point for country color (default / inert / in-scope / highlighted / correct / wrong / skipped). Add new visual states there, not in the JSX.

The reveal-zoom effect auto-frames the correct country when feedback appears (kind ≠ "correct") and zooms back out when feedback clears. Both transitions honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Continent filter

`state.selectedContinents` is persisted in localStorage (`atlasaur:selectedContinents`) and `showLabelsOnReveal` in `atlasaur:showLabelsOnReveal`. Loaders fall back to `ALL_CONTINENTS` / `true` on parse errors or unavailable storage (private mode, SSR — wrapped in try/catch). The `setContinents` action prunes `retryQueue` to the new scope and, if review-phase queue is now empty, auto-ends the review.

## Stack notes

- Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` — no `postcss.config` / `tailwind.config`. Styles are imported via `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/index.css`.
- Vite `base: "./"` so the build works under any subpath; required for the GitHub Pages deploy at `/Atlasaur/` (workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, triggers on push to `main`).
- React 19, TypeScript ~5.7, ESLint 9 flat config. Tests run in jsdom via Vitest 4.
